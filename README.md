# mvc-blog-website
Eleventh bootcamp challenge using what we have learned in class, with help from instructors, classmates, and outside research 
(YouTube tutorials, stack overflow, etc.) to make a full-stack Blog website. When you visit the site, you are presented with the homepage,
which includes existing blog posts, nav links for the homepage and login. When you click on login, you are prompted to sign up or log in.
When you click sign up, your credentials are saved and you are logged in. When you go to the profile page, you are prompted to add a new blog post,
view a previously submitted one, or delete an old post. When you click on viewing a post, you are presented with the title, content, author, and the prompt
to leave a comment on the post. When idle on the site for more than a set time, you are able to view posts and comments, but you must sign in before
you can alter the pages again.
